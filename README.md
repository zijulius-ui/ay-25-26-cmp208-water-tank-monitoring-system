Smart Water Tank Monitoring System


Project Title: Water Tank Monitoring System

Problem Statement:

Inefficient monitoring of water tanks can lead to water overflow, pump dry runs and delayed refilling,
resulting in water wastage, increased maintenance costs and unreliable water availability. Many
existing systems rely on manual checking or lack real-time reporting and alerts. This problem affects
not only students and teachers from Sir Arthur Lewis Community College, but it also mainly affects
homeowners. This problem should be rectified now as water wastage continues to occur due to
manual or unreliable monitoring methods. Also due to the rising cost of utility and maintenance costs,
it demands for smarter systems to reduce losses and improve efficiency


Project Overview:
The Water Tank Monitoring System is an embedded system and companion web application designed
to accurately measure and report the tank level, water quality and detect leaks in storage tanks. It will
also be able to control water flow via a pump and also to prevent dry runs via valves. The system uses
sensors to determine real-time water tank elements and alerts the users. This project improves water
management by preventing overflow, avoiding dry runs for pumps, and enabling timely refills saving
water, time, and maintenance costs.


Project Audience:

Homeowners
Educational Institutions
Facility Managers
Small commercial/residential property owners


Project Scope:

1) Design and build a prototype to measure the water level in the tank, water quality and to
detect leaks accurately across common tank geometries.

2) Implement a pressurized pump based supply system.

3) Implement valves for refilling the tank to prevent dry runs.

4) Develop microcontroller firmware to read sensors, filter data, compute volume and
percentage.

5) Implement real-time wireless communication (Wi-Fi) to transmit data to a cloud backend.

6) Build a backend system to store measurements, perform analytics (usage trends, leak
detection), and generate alerts.


Functionality:

1) Sensors will send notifications to the user’s phone when the tank is full/empty.
2) Sensors will send notifications to the user’s phone to say when the tank is possibly leaking.
3) A functioning web application that will be user-friendly to navigate and see data about the
tank.
4) Sensors will display water quality on the web application.
5) Sensors will display the temperature & amp; pressure of water on the web application.
6) Code will read data sent from sensors and determine how full the tank is.
7) A Wi-Fi connection will allow for real time data transfer between the tank and the internet.


Project Personnel:

1) Christian Collymore
Responsibilities:
- To build a prototype to measure tank level, water quality, pressure in the system and detecting
leaks accurately
- To implement water pump control and valves for refilling.

2) Zimran Julius
Responsibilities:
- To create a wireless connection to transfer data from sensors in tank to cloud
- To create a system (web application) to show the measurements, data and alerts.
- To create a code that is able to read sensors, filter data, compute volume and percentage from
the tank.
